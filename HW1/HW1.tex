\problem{1}

For the following mRNA sequence, can you extract its 5’ UTR, 3’ UTR
and the protein sequence?
ACTTGTCATGGTAACTCCGTCGTACCAGTAGGTCATG

\hrule

So the above is actually DNA, despite what the question says. I assume it is oriented 5' $\rightarrow$ 3' 
So we transcribe it into:

3' UGAACAGUACCAUUGAGGCAGCAUGGUCAUCCAGUAC 5'
%ACUUGUCAUGGUAACUCCGUCGUACCAGUAGGUCAUG

We translate it 5' $\rightarrow$ 3', so we need to flip it.

CAUGACCUACUGGUACGACGGAGUUACCAUGACAAGU

The start codon is AUG (Met), so the 5' UTR is everything left of this: which in this case is just C

We then translate,
AUGGUCAUCCAGUAC $\rightarrow$ MET, THR, TYR, TRP, TYR, ASP, GLY, VAL, THR, MET, THR, SER

We don't have a stop codon. So there is no UTR on the 3' end, and translation stops by hitting the end of the sequence.
